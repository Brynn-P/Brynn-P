Hi, I’m Brynn 👋

Conservationist turned cybersec student exploring Linux, Python, and security tooling.
Before starting this journey, I spent nearly a decade in wildlife conservation and physical security, and now I’m focused on applying that experience to cybersecurity and defensive tooling.

Currently learning and working on:

    Building a strong foundation in Python and starting to explore C++

    Becoming proficient with Bash and PowerShell scripting

    Developing security tools and experimenting with CTF‑style workflows

Tech stack / tools:

    Comfortable working in a Linux terminal

    Visual Studio Code / VSCodium

    Python (beginner–intermediate, growing steadily)

Projects to explore:

    weird_weather – a learning project where I practice Python, scripting, and general coding skills in a fun context.
