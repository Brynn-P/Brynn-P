Hi, I’m Brynn 👋

Conservationist turned cybersec student exploring Linux, Python,Go and security tooling.
Before starting this journey, I spent nearly a decade in wildlife conservation and physical security, and now I’m focused on applying that experience to cybersecurity and defensive tooling.

Currently learning and working on:

   • Building a strong foundation in Python and starting to explore C++

   • Becoming proficient with Bash and PowerShell scripting

   • Developing security tools and experimenting with CTF‑style workflows

Tech stack / tools:

   • Comfortable working in a Linux terminal

   • Visual Studio Code / VSCodium

   • Python (beginner–intermediate, growing steadily)

   • Golang (very beginer but enjoying this lang allot)

Projects to explore:

   • NetNoodle
   - NetNoodle is a tool I put together whilst competing in the NCL(National Cyber League) to help aid me with some of the challenges that I came accross during the games
   - https://github.com/Brynn-P/NetNoodle

   • weird_weather:
   - a learning project where I practice Python, scripting, and general coding skills in a fun context.

   • Best way to reach me right now is via my GitHub profile email.

I am always open to learning‑focused collaboration on security tooling and scripting projects.
